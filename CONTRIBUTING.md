# Contributing to Open Rails

This document will introduce you to a number of ways you can contribute to Open Rails, and how we expect the process to go - both from your side and our side.

## Discussion

Please see the [Community](http://openrails.org/share/community/) page on our website for details of the forums where Open Rails discussion happens.

## Reporting a bug

If you've found a bug in Open Rails, please report it in [our bug tracker on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/or).

## Making a suggestion

If you've got an idea for Open Rails, please report it in [our road-map on Trello](https://trello.com/b/DS2h3Pxc/open-rails-roadmap).

## Writing code

All of the main Open Rails code is C# and your contribution is expected to also be in C#. We're currently using [version 7.3 of C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3), so please take advantage of these features.

Code is expected to follow the [Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/) throughout, especially the [Naming Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines), with few exceptions:

* Structures, fields, and enums defining file format components may be named exactly as in the file format
* Public and protected fields are allowed, although care must be taken with public fields

Code style (placement of braces, etc.) is expected to follow the default Visual Studio rules; the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) provides a good basis for many aspects.

## Reviewing pull requests

TBD.
